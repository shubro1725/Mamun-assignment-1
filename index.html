            <h2>Professional Web Developer</h2>
            <p>Hi! Mamun here. I first started to learn programming for
                finding out of curiosity. I started to develop a passion for helping small
                businesses grow and I wanted to do this by amplifying their online
                presence. The best way for me to do this, or at least to start, is by
                building websites for small businesses in my area to really help them
                grow. </p>

            My Mission in <span class="red">2022</span>
        </h1>

        <div class="divider">
            <div class="mission" id="bg-color_1">

                    <hr>
                </h5>
                <p>
                    First and foremost, you must view the project in a calm state of mind. By simply observing, you may
                    envision the project and design the pattern in your thoughts. All you have to do now is figure out
                    what you need to do. You may take a step ahead in your Misson by doing so.
                </p>

            <div class="mission bg-color" id="bg-color_2">

                <h5>Thinking
                    <hr>
                </h5>
                <p>
                    You must consider the project when you have observed it. Thinking about how you'll take your initial
                    step, how you'll apply your observation, how many parts or patterns your work has, and so on are all
                    possibilities. Last but not least, you must consider your deadline. Ensure that your job is
                    completed before the deadline.

                </p>

            </div>

            <div class="mission" id="bg-color_3">

                <h5> Applying
                    <hr>
                </h5>
                <p>
                    Your project will become a reality as a result of your observation and reasoning. You can't make any
                    genuine progress unless you put your thoughts and observations into practice. As a result, you'll
                    need to put everything you've learned thus far into practice in order to bring your idea to life.
                    People can see the effect of your hard effort.
