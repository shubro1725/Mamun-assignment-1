            <h3>Professional Web Developer</h3>
            <p>Hi! Mamun here. I first started to learn programming for
                finding out of curiosity. I started to develop a passion for helping small
                businesses grow and I wanted to do this by amplifying their online
                presence. The best way for me to do this, or at least to start, is by
                building websites for small businesses in my area to really help them
                grow.</p>

            <h2>Become a web developer</h2>
            <p>
                It's not as easy as many people think. Yes, it's difficult, but if you spend
                some time learning programming and do it regularly, you'll learn
                everything that is needed to become a developer and you'll get your
                first job without a computer science degree! Self-motivated Web
                Developer with high level of experience working on multiple projects.

                I am the master of HTML, CSS and Javascript. I know everything needed to make a website function,
                efficient. I didn't stop with the web. I went beyond with most popular Javascript framework called Vue
                JS. I even know the deployment, server and security. I will give you 100% web solution.

            <p>They didn't offer me a job. But I made myself as a remove web developer. I made their website and
                showed it to them. They liked it. And uploaded the content. It was fun working at Programming Hero.
